# Eat-Da-Burger
unit 14-handlebars ...is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Description
This full stack application demonstrates the techniques and technologies needed to create a 'real world' solution. The layout utilizes an MVC design pattern with the seperation of concerns maintained. The implementation uses Node.js, Express, mySQl, and Handlebars among others.

A user can enter a burger name which gets added to the menu. Once there it can be 'eaten' or devoured as the button label shows. This causes the item to be removed from the menu list and added to the devoured list.

## Demo

The demo of the burger eating application can be found [here](https://????.herokuapp.com/).
